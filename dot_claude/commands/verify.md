# Verify Work

Go back and verify all your work so far. Review everything you've done in this session and check:

## Code Quality
- Are you following best coding practices for this language/framework?
- Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- Are functions/methods appropriately sized and single-purpose?
- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
- Is there proper error handling?

## Efficiency
- Are there any unnecessary operations or redundant code?
- Could any algorithms be optimized?
- Are you avoiding N+1 queries or similar performance issues?
- Are resources being properly managed (closed connections, freed memory, etc.)?

## Security
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)?
- Is sensitive data properly protected?
- Are inputs validated and sanitized?
- Are secrets/credentials properly handled (not hardcoded)?
- Are permissions and access controls appropriate?

## Completeness
- Did you complete all tasks that were requested?
- Are there any edge cases not handled?
- Is there anything you forgot to clean up?

Provide a summary of what you verified and any issues found. If you find problems, fix them.
